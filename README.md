## The Data
I got the Data from [Bike Sharing Demand Kaggle challenge!](<https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/overview>)

## Bike Sharing Demand

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

### Data Fields

The data has the following features:

- datetime - hourly date + timestamp 
- season -  1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter 
- holiday - whether the day is considered a holiday
- workingday - whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday
- weather 
  - 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy
  - 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
  - 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
  - 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog 
- temp - temperature in Celsius
- atemp - "feels like" temperature in Celsius
- humidity - relative humidity
- windspeed - wind speed
- casual - number of non-registered user rentals initiated
- registered - number of registered user rentals initiated
- count - number of total rentals

## Exploratory Data Analysis
#### We create a scatter plot of count vs temp. and set a good alpha value.

**Plot count versus datetime as a scatterplot with a color gradient based on temperature. We have to convert the datetime column into POSIXct before plotting**.

**We noticed two things: A seasonality to the data, for winter and summer. Also that bike rental counts are increasing in general. This may present a problem with using a linear regression model if the data is non-linear.** 

#### What is the correlation between temp and count?

         temp     count
temp  1.0000000 0.3944536
count 0.3944536 1.0000000

**The correlation is 0,39.**

**Let's explore the season data. We will create a boxplot, with the y axis indicating count and the x axis begin a box for each season.**

**This says:**

* A line can't capture a non-linear relationship.
* There are more rentals in winter than in spring.

**We know of these issues because of the growth of rental count, this isn't due to the actual season**

## Feature Engineering

We create an "hour" column that takes the hour from the datetime column.

**Now we will create a scatterplot of count versus hour, with color scale based on temp. We only use bike data where workingday==1.**

**Now we create the same plot for non working days:**

![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93712013/158592769-6d12866e-7f41-4afd-acaa-943238125f18.jpeg)

**We should have noticed that working days have peak activity during the morning (~8am) and right after work gets out (~5pm), with some lunchtime activity. While the non-work days have a steady rise and fall for the afternoon**

**Now let's continue by trying to build a model, we'll begin by just looking at a single feature.**

## Building the Model
**We use lm() to build a model that predicts count based solely on the temp feature**

![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93712013/158593236-2e137d89-7a19-4eea-9b3b-21163a974850.jpeg)

### Interpreting the intercept (β0):

* It is the value of y when x=0.
* Thus, it is the estimated number of rentals when the temperature is 0 degrees Celsius.
* Note: It does not always make sense to interpret the intercept.

## Interpreting the "temp" coefficient (β1):

* It is the change in y divided by change in x, or the "slope".
* Thus, a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is associated with a rental increase of 9.17 bikes.
* This is not a statement of causation.
* β1 would be negative if an increase in temperature was associated with a decrease in rentals.


**How many bike rentals would we predict if the temperature was 25 degrees Celsius? We will calculate this two ways:**

* Using the values we just got above
* Using the predict() function

We should get around 235.3 bikes.

* Method 1
6.0462 + 9.17*25  =  **235.2962**

* Method 2
```
temp.test <- data.frame(temp=c(25))
predict(temp.model,temp.test)

```
